After a day of 'extroverting' at work, introverts usually need some time alone to recharge their mental batteries. ISFPs are also quite private, so that means you sometimes keep your true feelings to yourself. You might hold back your thoughts, feelings, and opinions with other people in your life, even your romantic partners. ISFPs have strong values but are not concerned with trying to convince other people to share them. They care deeply about other people, particularly their closest friends and family. They are action-oriented and tend to show their care and concern through action rather than discussing feelings or expressing sentiments.",

Because ISFPs prefer to focus on the present, you'll also probably prefer a job that focuses on solving practical, real-world problems. But you also don't like to feel hemmed in, so consider options that give you a lot of personal freedom and autonomy."
