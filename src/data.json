You might be outgoing and gregarious around your close friends, but a lot more closed off when you are in a large crowd of strangers. After a day of 'extroverting' at work, introverts usually need some time alone to recharge their mental batteries. ISFPs are also quite private, so that means you sometimes keep your true feelings to yourself. You might hold back your thoughts, feelings, and opinions with other people in your life, even your romantic partners. ISFPs have strong values but are not concerned with trying to convince other people to share them. They care deeply about other people, particularly their closest friends and family. They are action-oriented and tend to show their care and concern through action rather than discussing feelings or expressing sentiments.",

Because ISFPs prefer to focus on the present, you'll also probably prefer a job that focuses on solving practical, real-world problems. But you also don't like to feel hemmed in, so consider options that give you a lot of personal freedom and autonomy."

They are altruistic and interested in helping others, which can sometimes come off as a bit overbearing. Despite this, they are usually very well liked and people appreciate their genuine concern and care. As parents, ENFJs are nurturing and warm, although they can sometimes be accused of being so-called helicopter parents. They are directly involved in their children's lives, although they can sometimes be quite strict and even rigid at times. ENFJs have an outgoing personality and enjoy spending time with other people. Being in social settings helps them feel energized. In friendships and other relationships, people typically describe people with a protagonist personality as supportive and fun to be around. They are particularly good at relating to others and are known to help bring out the best in the people with whom they spend their time.",
